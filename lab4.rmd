Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA & KNN
--------------------------------
###Stock market data.
Begin with some data exploration.
```{r}
library(ISLR)
names(Smarket)
dim(Smarket)
summary(Smarket)
```
The class to predict is clearly `Direction`. Doing some visualizations...

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
l1vsl2<-ggplot(data = Smarket,aes(x=Lag1,y=Lag2,size=Volume,col=Direction)) + geom_jitter(alpha=0.4)+theme_classic()+ggtitle("Movements from one day before to 2 days before")

l1vsl2
```
